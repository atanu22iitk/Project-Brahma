# Project-Brahma
1. This is an MTech Project at IIT Kanpur. This project delivers a healthcare and EHR application based on Blockchain using Hyperledger Fabric.

3. Add and replace config folder(/fabric-samples/config) with brahma-config folder. Necessary changes have already been made in the register Enroll.sh file. No need to worry.
