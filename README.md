# Project-Brahma
This is an MTech Project at IIT Kanpur. This project delivers a healthcare and EHR application based on Blockchain using Hyperledger Fabric.
Use the Brahma_network folder to replace first-network/Test-network folder after completing the installation of Hyperledger fabric in your local machine. 
Add and replace config folder(/fabric-samples/config) with brahma-config folder. Necessary changes have already been made in the registerEnroll.sh file. No need to worry.
Please follow the complete installation guide in the link https://dev.to/deadwin19/how-to-install-hyperledger-fabric-v24-on-ubuntu-2004-236f.
